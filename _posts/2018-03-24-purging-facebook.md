title: Purging Facebook
---

Facebook has been in the news a lot lately with the recent revelations that they enabled Cambridge Analytica to scrape data on about 50 million people (as of the latest estimate I read). When a post came up about how you actually delete your account rather than deactivate it, I realised that years ago, that's exactly what I did because I was frustrated that I couldn't delete it. Following [Ramy Kuffash's](https://pageflows.com/blog/delete-facebook/) post, I found out how to delete rather than just deactivate my account. 

But another something sly I did spy. Facebook suggest that you download all of your data before you delete your account. This isn't the same as demanding by law (through a FOI request maybe?) that they hand over everything they hold on you. I don't know what is missing, and they are not obliged to tell me. It's true that they've had a flood of requests for data, and they may be offering everything I could ever get, but I'm also wary that they control the details of the request. It might be interesting to see what each of two approaches yield.
