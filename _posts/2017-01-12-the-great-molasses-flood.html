<p>The Futility Closet podcastÂ  is part of the boing boing family of podcasts, and seems to feature interesting stories from history. Today's podcast featured the story of the 1919 Boston molasses disaster, where a tank containing about 8000 cubic metres of molasses failed and flooded an area of Boston. The wave of molasses at its peak reached 25ft high and moved at 35mph, killed 21 people and numerous animals, and destroyed some buildings. It took weeks to clean up and people claimed they could smell molasses for decades afterwards.</p>
