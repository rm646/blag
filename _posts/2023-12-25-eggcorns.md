I realised that my vision of regularly adding to amusing lists and adding more lists didn't work, so after cringing a bit at my past self's sense of humour
I'm moving or deleting the list index section.

One of the lists was misremembered phrases which made me laugh. They're a lot like [eggcorns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggcorn) e.g.
free reign (instead of free rein) I suppose.

They are:
- Cherry on the cake
- Flash in the pot
- Damp Squat
- Falling over backwards (to please someone)
- I'm double guessing myself
- Don't make me implicit in this
- Dull as chips
- Frothing at the bit
- Pissing bricks
- In and out like a doormouse (courtesy of my dad wrote a porno s1e8)
- Like shooting rats in a barrel
- Living life in the bus lane
- He has his fingers in many puddings
- That really grates my cheese
- Thorn in my eye
