title: Russian Dances

I've liked the [Red Army Choir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L1Eh5iJBS4&t=54s) for a while now, and I was pleased to find floating dancers performing the [Berezka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk_ga0Y_lnM) dance. On that theme, I also liked the dance for [Kalinka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OANzLIuxhNo) and an [ensemble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVmnDZIHW3g) by the perfoming bit of the Red Army, though I think the [dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtZTFMwxgNo) version of that might be better, maybe.
