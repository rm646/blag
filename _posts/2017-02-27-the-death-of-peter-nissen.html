<p>While flicking through an old issue of the magazine 'Popular Mechanics' I came across the story of Peter Nissen. He had built something like a giant (22 feet in diameter, and 32 feet long, pill shaped I assume) inflated canvas ball, with a shaft running through its centre, from which a seat would hang. The idea was that the ball would be driven across the ocean by wind, bounding over any obstacles.</p>
<p>Apparently he'd had some success on Niagra's rapids, and he wanted to try again, this time crossing Lake Michigan - 307 miles long and 118 miles wide, it's not clear which way he aimed. He tried it once when there wasn't enough wind, so he chose to try again in the middle of a furious winter storm that kept steamer ships in the port, setting off just as dusk fell. He must have had some sense of humour, since the craft was called "The Foolkiller No. III". There were provisions for two days, and a hose ran from inside to outside to supply fresh air and to re-inflate the ball. He left his overcoat off and met a tug boat two miles out, but refused assistance. By midnight, the wind was blowing at 50mph.</p>
<p>They found his frozen corpse and the remains of the ball two days later, a hundred miles away. The ball had reached the shore, but failed to roll up and out of the water. After cutting his way out, he was polished off by the surf. A note was found in his pocket which read "Air hose has broken. N."</p>
