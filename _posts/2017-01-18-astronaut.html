<p>This site shows you videos from youtube with zero views. It's strange, and reminds me of the segments sometimes played in films or documentaries to capture the essence of a time period. I seem to get a lot of home movie type of thing. If you press spacebar, it replaces the video audio with some peaceful piano.</p>
