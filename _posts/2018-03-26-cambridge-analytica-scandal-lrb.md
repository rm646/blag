title: The Cambridge Analytica Furore
---

I've just read a good article on this by William Davies in the [London Review of Books](https://www.lrb.co.uk/v40/n07/william-davies/why-the-outrage). Let me recap what I understand of it all, without going into the detail that the newspapers will inevitably do better. In order to encourage developers onto their platform, Facebook offer data. Users consent to this use in the T&Cs (which is a post for another day), but they also consent to this use if their friends use some developer's app. This is what allowed an academic studying psychology - through an app which only 270,000 people used - to gather data on 50 million people. He then, for a reason I don't know, passed this data to Cambridge Analytica, who claim to have used this in their analysis and micro-targeting to swing the American election and others. This is a grandiose and difficult to prove claim, as Davies notes.

Whether any of these data flows broke the law is still being worked out, but it's exposed some unseemly goings-on within Facebook. For one thing, Facebook failed their own rules in checking that developers used the data as mandated. They gave up control and turned a blind eye to its use, according to its own compliance officer.

Anyway, I digress. What I want to talk about is what Davies points out. People are treating CA as if it is a secret election control room that can be blamed for Trump's rise:

> > Cambridge Analytica looks conveniently like a smoking gun, primarily because it has repeatedly bragged that it is one. Nix and Turnbull do for the events of 2016 what ‘Fabulous’ Fab Tourre, former Goldman Sachs banker, and Fred ‘The Shred’ Goodwin, former boss of RBS, did for the banking crisis of 2008, providing grotesque personalities on which to focus anger and alarm. To hear such men proudly declaring their lack of moral conscience is paradoxically reassuring to the degree that it helps explain the world’s loss of moral direction. But as with the financial crisis, the circus risks distracting from the real institutional and political questions, in this case concerning companies such as Facebook and the model of capitalism that tolerates, facilitates and even celebrates their extensive and sophisticated forms of data harvesting and analysis.

I'd like to tie in here a note on the power of the data harvesting and analysis to reshape the systems they describe (The classic example is Google's early days, where they ranked webpages based on [links to them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank), only to find that websites remodelled themselves to climb this ranking). I don't think I've thought about it enough yet, so I'll save that for another day.
