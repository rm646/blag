title: Odd Colognes
---

I'd like there to be colognes which have simpler, or at least better defined, fragrance offerings.
Here are a few suggestions:
- Moss
- Burning rubber
- Burnt Popcorn
- Parma Violets
- Orange
- Petrol - I hear some like it
- Warm olive oil
- Gingerbread
- Wet dog
- Gas - people will notice you
- Freshly baked bread
- Wood
- Blood - the slightly metallic quality should be prominent
- Sea air
- Tobacco - not smoke, just the leaf
- Wet bamboo
- Mint &amp; basil
- Woodsmoke &amp; coffee
- Curry
- Gorse flower
- Bleach
