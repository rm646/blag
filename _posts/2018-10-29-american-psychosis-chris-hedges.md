title: American Psychosis - Chris Hedges
---

A very wide-ranging short about totalitarian systems with Chris Hedges, film-maker Amanda Zackem? I liked the mention of specific acts of law to support the point that draconian laws have already been made. I think I'll have to let this chunk of potato stew in my head for a while along with the other vegetables like Adam Curtis' documentaries about power in society.
