title: Early Kraftwerk
---

I found this early video of live [Kraftwerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraftwerk "Kraftwerk on Wikipedia") from 1970, when they were formed. Far more droning and dark than more recent stuff. It starts with a good few minutes of death robot groans and no-one appears to know what's going on. It starts kicking off a bit after 7:00 minutes in, with another good bit starting about 13:00.
