  review: I think the main thrust of the book is about gender roles. The chapter titles highlight old stereotypes 'Boys Love Sport', 'Boys Don't Cry', 'Men Don't Need Therapy' etc. but the story he tells is intensely personal, and brave in its honesty - I would struggle to publish any of my teen diaries or whining, but he does, and his teenage character is much more vivid and real for it. He shows how he grew up in tension with what was expected of boys and men, and the pain he felt along the way. This is interesting to me, particularly recently as I realise that although I hardly think about my gender role or skin colour, that doesn't mean I am not part of a biased system that subtly (or blatantly) enforces itself. As you'd expect, it's funny, but it's also super engaging and real. I think that's its genius - it makes the abstract idea of gender stereotypes (which he calls 'The Trick' when explaining to his kid) and how they affected him relatable on an emotional level. Good read.

  review: Overall, not bad. My main gripe is that it reads like a stack of newspaper articles stapled together. Specifically, I don't really feel like there was a clear take-away message. He works at an Amazon warehouse in Rugeley, as a care-worker in Blackpool, at a call-centre in South Wales, and for Uber in London. But at the end of the book, I'm left thinking about lots of elements, like dignity and pride in work, the importance of unions, collapse of industry, the nature of the gig economy, all sorts. It's not that the book doesn't discuss these, it just feels like it's not well concluded, ending on broad notes of class when most of the book has been talking about intimate, personal experience without, in my mind, making the larger narrative clear. The most value I got out of this book was the description of working in the jobs, and bit more respect for the work of unions in changing everday things like break times and sick leave.
