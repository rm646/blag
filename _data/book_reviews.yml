  review: >
    Four hundred and forty pages in about a week - very readable. Exciting writing that still
    gave me a picture of events which stuck, horrified, and thrilled. I don't think
    I'll ever forget lice hanging like bunches of grapes from soldiers' eyebrows, or
    some of the appalling wastes of life. I think one 'workers militia' barely equipped
    with small arms was sent against a panzer division and promptly annihilated. The Russians
    had two lines at times; one to attack, and another behind them to shoot retreaters.
    The dynamics between officers and leaders on both sides was very interesting. Hitler refused to allow
    retreat or withdrawal at key times for example despite officers recognizing the precariousness of their position.
    I developed a particularly low opinion of General Walter Heitz, who ordered that 'we fight to last bullet but one'
    while he almost certainly prepared a surrender plan for himself. I imagine I'll be reading more
    Beevor soon.

- title: "How Democracy Ends"
  author: David Runciman
  ISBN: 9781781259740
  publisher: Profile Books Ltd.
  review: >
    I quite enjoyed this at the time, but it seems to have mostly evaporated from my mind.
    Runciman goes through how democracy is traditionally thought to end, and how it might
    be subverted less obviously. He discusses how catastrophe threatens democracy by being
    an existential risk; democracy obviously matters less than survival (to me anyway), but
    of course the difficulty is in weighing the risk properly. Finally, he ends by guessing where
    technology might lead us. To transcendence of mortality for a few? De-individuation? He concludes
    that Western democracy as we know it is past its prime, but that it isn't our identity - we can go
    on without it (unless we all perish). Honestly, it didn't make a huge impression on me, but I'm
    not sure I can blame Runciman entirely for that. In his LRB writings I find that I don't get on with his style
    easily, so that's a factor.

- title: "Prisoners of Geography"
  author: Tim Marshall
  ISBN: 9781783962433
  publisher: Elliot and Thompson Ltd.

    I learned a lot about the relationship between geography and its relationship
    to how countries developed and operate. The book discusses Russia, China,
    USA, Western Europe, Africa, The Middle East, India and Pakistan, Korea and Japan,
    Latin America, and the Arctic in turn. Russia is vast, but the North European Plain
    allows easy military access to it from Europe (through Poland I think). It also lacks
    a warm water port, which limits its trading greatly. China is similarly large, and has
    a huge population and ancient civilisation. It relations with India are interesting,
    because they have little violent friction despite their proximity and size. This is explained
    by the mountain range (Himalayas?) separating them, though China does want to completely
    control the Tibetan plateau because that's where its water comes from. The USA
    is militarily very well secured by two oceans, and now has a good supply of oil on its own
    territory. Western Europe has a great river system for trading, but there's a north-south divide.
    Africa is big, has a desert running across it, but it's infrastructure is extractive; roads go to the coast,
    rather than interlink, and its coast isn't easy to access (no deep draughts).
    The Middle East is knackered by imposed borders (Sykes-Picot) which ignore terrain and ethnic
    distribution. India and Pakistan is tense and control of water resources could cause trouble.
    Korea and Japan I don't recall much of. Latin America is mountainous and full of jungle. The Arctic
    was interesting: plenty of oil is predicted to be there, and Russia leads the way in icebreakers
    ($1 billion and ten years to build one) of which they have thirty-two (six of those are nuclear).
    Overall, very interesting.

    I don't have this one to hand so I can't remind myself of the details. I didn't
    enjoy this nearly as much as The Trial. The delightful dialogue is still there,
    and the exchanges are still hilariously formal and surreal at times; the protagonist's
    uncle is in the process of educating him, but when he stays out past midnight one
    evening, his uncle has a letter delivered to him which asks him to break off all
    contact and never come back. There was a very funny character too - a fat woman
    who lay on a couch all day and forced everyone else out onto a balcony while
    she lay there. As I write now, I remember just how much I enjoyed the surrealism.
    In a local election, the candidates are carried around on large men's shoulders
    while their supporters bay at the others. Sadly, the book was unfinished, so that left a
    sour taste.

    Excellent. I was completely gripped by how odd it was. Characters speak to each
    other in a very precise and deliberate way. I only had to open the book to find an example, where
    the protagonist K is speaking to 'the Inspector'. Inspector -
    'You are presumably very surprised at the events of this morning?', K - 'Certainly',
    K - 'Certainly, I am surprised, but I am by no means very surprised.'
    I loved this comically precise style, and for some time after reading it I
    aped it when I spoke. I find myself chattering without thinking sometimes so
    this really appealed to me. The evolution of K's case is mysterious and made
    me burst out loud laughing at times - when K had gone to see a painter in his studio
    and felt obliged to buy a dreary heath landscape, the painter kept offering him
    other which to K's eye were exactly the same. He ends up buying four of them I think.

- title: "How Not To Be A Boy"
  author: Robert Webb

  review: >
    I think the main thrust of the book is about gender roles.
    The chapter titles highlight old stereotypes 'Boys Love Sport',
    'Boys Don't Cry', 'Men Don't Need Therapy' etc.
    but the story he tells is intensely personal, and brave in its honesty
    - I would struggle to publish any of my teen diaries or whining,
    but he does, and his teenage character is much more vivid for it.
    He shows how he grew up in tension with what was expected of boys and men,
     and the pain he felt along the way. This is interesting to me, particularly recently as I realise that although I hardly think about my gender role or skin colour, that doesn't mean I am not part of a biased system that subtly (or blatantly) enforces itself. As you'd expect, it's funny, but it's also super engaging and real. I think that's its genius - it makes the abstract idea of gender stereotypes (which he calls 'The Trick' when explaining to his kid) and how they affected him relatable on an emotional level. Good read.

- title: "Hired: Six Months Undercover in Low-Wage Britain"
  author: James Bloodworth
  ISBN: 9781786490148
  publisher: Atlantic Books
  review: >
    Overall, not bad. My main gripe is that it reads like a
    stack of newspaper articles stapled together.
    Specifically, I don't really feel like there was a clear take-away message.
    He works at an Amazon warehouse in Rugeley, as a care-worker in Blackpool,
    at a call-centre in South Wales, and for Uber in London.
    But at the end of the book, I'm left thinking about lots of elements,
    like dignity and pride in work, the importance of unions,
    collapse of industry, the nature of the gig economy, all sorts.
    It's not that the book doesn't discuss these, it just feels like it's not well concluded,
    ending on broad notes of class when most of the book has been talking about
    intimate, personal experience without, in my mind, making
    the larger narrative clear. The most value I got out of this book
    was the description of working in the jobs, and bit more respect
    for the work of unions in changing everday things like break times
    and sick leave.
