review: >
  Overall I enjoyed it, but it had flaws. For some reason I found the writing irritatingly
  clumsy at first, but when I scanned the first chapter again I couldn't pick out the phrases that bothered me.
  Maybe I was being unfair if the same phrases don't bother me again, or maybe the book charmed me by the end.
  Sad old grey man Harold Fry has a sudden rush of feeling when he hears an old friend is dying, and must do something.
  Inspired by a conversation with a stranger, decides to walk a few hundred miles to her to deliver a message; keeping her alive with hope. 
  Some of the life lessons from other strangers came a bit thick and easily for my taste, and the transformation to bearded ascetic seemed
  a bit implausible for a man who'd been passive for so long.
  I enjoyed Harold metaphorically walking through his memories, that idea resonated with me; walking alone can really let my mind wander.
