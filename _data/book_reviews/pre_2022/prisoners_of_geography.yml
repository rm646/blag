review: >
  I learned a lot about the relationship between geography and its relationship
  to how countries developed and operate. The book discusses Russia, China,
  USA, Western Europe, Africa, The Middle East, India and Pakistan, Korea and Japan,
  Latin America, and the Arctic in turn. Russia is vast, but the North European Plain
  allows easy military access to it from Europe (through Poland I think). It also lacks
  a warm water port, which limits its trading greatly. China is similarly large, and has
  a huge population and ancient civilisation. It relations with India are interesting,
  because they have little violent friction despite their proximity and size. This is explained
  by the mountain range (Himalayas?) separating them, though China does want to completely
  control the Tibetan plateau because that's where its water comes from. The USA
  is militarily very well secured by two oceans, and now has a good supply of oil on its own
  territory. Western Europe has a great river system for trading, but there's a north-south divide.
  Africa is big, has a desert running across it, but it's infrastructure is extractive; roads go to the coast,
  rather than interlink, and its coast isn't easy to access (no deep draughts).
  The Middle East is knackered by imposed borders (Sykes-Picot) which ignore terrain and ethnic
  distribution. India and Pakistan is tense and control of water resources could cause trouble.
  Korea and Japan I don't recall much of. Latin America is mountainous and full of jungle. The Arctic
  was interesting: plenty of oil is predicted to be there, and Russia leads the way in icebreakers
  ($1 billion and ten years to build one) of which they have thirty-two (six of those are nuclear).
  Overall, very interesting.
