review: >
  Overall, not bad. My main gripe is that it reads like a
  stack of newspaper articles stapled together.
  Specifically, I don't really feel like there was a clear take-away message.
  He works at an Amazon warehouse in Rugeley, as a care-worker in Blackpool,
  at a call-centre in South Wales, and for Uber in London.
  But at the end of the book, I'm left thinking about lots of elements,
  like dignity and pride in work, the importance of unions,
  collapse of industry, the nature of the gig economy, all sorts.
  It's not that the book doesn't discuss these, it just feels like it's not well concluded,
  ending on broad notes of class when most of the book has been talking about
  intimate, personal experience without, in my mind, making
  the larger narrative clear. The most value I got out of this book
  was the description of working in the jobs, and bit more respect
  for the work of unions in changing everday things like break times
  and sick leave.
