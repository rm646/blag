review: >
  It's been a while since I actually read this, and I've returned it to the
  library so I can only give a brief, vague impression. It was interesting
  to read about war from the perspective of an actual trooper. I got a sense
  of the daily routine (marching, entrenching, scavenging, guarding), but also
  a sense of how he fit in as part of the war machine I'm used to reading about.
  It follows him from the D-day landings, through some operations I can't remember,
  with some gaps when he was injured, to looting champagne at the end of the war
  in Berchtesgarden - a famous retreat of Hitler's. One example of brutality
  stuck with me; after a raid across a river to capture German prisoners, one
  prisoner is too badly wounded to be carried back, and is left on the banks of the
  German side. He lies there for days, moaning, but the Germans don't dare retrieve
  him. I think a part of Americans throws a grenade at him, fails to kill him, and
  a second party has to go and throw several more to finish him off. Overall,
  it was a worthwhile read, but I don't fancy any more of the same.
