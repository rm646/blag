review: >
  I quite enjoyed this at the time, but it seems to have mostly evaporated from my mind.
  Runciman goes through how democracy is traditionally thought to end, and how it might
  be subverted less obviously. He discusses how catastrophe threatens democracy by being
  an existential risk; democracy obviously matters less than survival (to me anyway), but
  of course the difficulty is in weighing the risk properly. Finally, he ends by guessing where
  technology might lead us. To transcendence of mortality for a few? De-individuation? He concludes
  that Western democracy as we know it is past its prime, but that it isn't our identity - we can go
  on without it (unless we all perish). Honestly, it didn't make a huge impression on me, but I'm
  not sure I can blame Runciman entirely for that. In his LRB writings I find that I don't get on with his style
  easily, so that's a factor.
