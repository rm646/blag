review: >
  Four hundred and forty pages in about a week - very readable. Exciting writing that still
  gave me a picture of events which stuck, horrified, and thrilled. I don't think
  I'll ever forget lice hanging like bunches of grapes from soldiers' eyebrows, or
  some of the appalling wastes of life. I think one 'workers militia' barely equipped
  with small arms was sent against a panzer division and promptly annihilated. The Russians
  had two lines at times; one to attack, and another behind them to shoot retreaters.
  The dynamics between officers and leaders on both sides was very interesting. Hitler refused to allow
  retreat or withdrawal at key times for example despite officers recognizing the precariousness of their position.
  I developed a particularly low opinion of General Walter Heitz, who ordered that 'we fight to last bullet but one'
  while he almost certainly prepared a surrender plan for himself. I imagine I'll be reading more
  Beevor soon.
