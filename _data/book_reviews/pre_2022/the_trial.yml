review: >
  Excellent. I was completely gripped by how odd it was. Characters speak to each
  other in a very precise and deliberate way. I only had to open the book to find an example, where
  the protagonist K is speaking to 'the Inspector'. Inspector -
  'You are presumably very surprised at the events of this morning?', K - 'Certainly',
  K - 'Certainly, I am surprised, but I am by no means very surprised.'
  I loved this comically precise style, and for some time after reading it I
  aped it when I spoke. I find myself chattering without thinking sometimes so
  this really appealed to me. The evolution of K's case is mysterious and made
  me burst out loud laughing at times - when K had gone to see a painter in his studio
  and felt obliged to buy a dreary heath landscape, the painter kept offering him
  other which to K's eye were exactly the same. He ends up buying four of them I think.
