review: >
  “Use your head to acquire assets” In a sentence, that is the book. It's very short - I read it over a weekend trip to Canterbury - and in reading it quickly I have not taken note of his set of rules for getting rich, but two points Kiyosaki made resonated with me. First, the importance of continuing to learn. Second, to acquire assets because the number of hours I can work is limited, but owned assets work in parallel.
  I found myself resisting this book at times; I found myself getting irritated, and not wanting to keep reading. 'This is not how things should be' I thought to myself. Why should people who are good at buying, making deals, and owning things earn so much more than any other professional? I still think this, but I have resigned myself to the fact that owning assets is in fact a very good way to make money. Will I take his advice and seek opportunities, risking money for more money? Kiyosaki admits that one has to really want to make money to succeed, and I don't know if that is what I want, even if it is a route to what I want (whatever that is).
  Nevertheless, I did enjoy most of the book. I liked, for example, his faith that he can keep learning and his application of what he learns. He tells a story of learning about something called a tax lien (we don't have this in the UK) from a book, then he talks to a tax office worker about these instruments and finds that she invests in these things, then he goes with her and invests. I find this use of multiple sources of information, along with gauging the risk by her investment, and using her expertise to invest impressive. I like to think that I'm more interested in statistics and metrics, but a good anecdote can stick. I suppose this is good and bad: I think it is good to take action rather than wonder, but I honestly have no idea if it's all bollocks yet I'm taken in by it.
  I'm not going to become an investor overnight, but I have been inspired to learn more about money and to make a little more effort to talk to my friends and family about money and investing.
