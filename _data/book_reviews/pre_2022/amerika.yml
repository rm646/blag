review: >
  I don't have this one to hand so I can't remind myself of the details. I didn't
  enjoy this nearly as much as The Trial. The delightful dialogue is still there,
  and the exchanges are still hilariously formal and surreal at times; the protagonist's
  uncle is in the process of educating him, but when he stays out past midnight one
  evening, his uncle has a letter delivered to him which asks him to break off all
  contact and never come back. There was a very funny character too - a fat woman
  who lay on a couch all day and forced everyone else out onto a balcony while
  she lay there. As I write now, I remember just how much I enjoyed the surrealism.
  In a local election, the candidates are carried around on large men's shoulders
  while their supporters bay at the others. Sadly, the book was unfinished, so that left a
  sour taste.
