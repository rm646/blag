review: >
  I think the main thrust of the book is about gender roles.
  The chapter titles highlight old stereotypes 'Boys Love Sport',
  'Boys Don't Cry', 'Men Don't Need Therapy' etc.
  but the story he tells is intensely personal, and brave in its honesty
  - I would struggle to publish any of my teen diaries or whining,
  but he does, and his teenage character is much more vivid for it.
  He shows how he grew up in tension with what was expected of boys and men,
   and the pain he felt along the way. This is interesting to me, particularly recently as I realise that although I hardly think about my gender role or skin colour, that doesn't mean I am not part of a biased system that subtly (or blatantly) enforces itself. As you'd expect, it's funny, but it's also super engaging and real. I think that's its genius - it makes the abstract idea of gender stereotypes (which he calls 'The Trick' when explaining to his kid) and how they affected him relatable on an emotional level. Good read.
