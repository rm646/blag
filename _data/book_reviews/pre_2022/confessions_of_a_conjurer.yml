review: >
  Dicey, overall. I was frustrated enough to almost stop reading at two points:
  once a few pages in, and once about three-quarters through. The first thorn in my
  eye was the overly flowery language and judgemental tone. The tone eased off quickly
  and the language calmed a bit too after a few more pages. The second thorn was the
  terrible abuse of footnotes. I read about five pages in a row where the footnotes
  took up half the page and ran over them. This was a pattern throughout the book,
  and quickly irritated me and seemed unneccessary. The book follows him as he
  performs a card trick at a table in a restaurant, and dives into various
  ramblings along the way. A few diversions are funny, such as
  his classmate who ends every story with 'Then I woke up. Then I died.'
  Most are just a bit boring. Perhaps he delights in thinking about the detail
  in everyday matters and how we form our 'sense-memory'. But the disconnection
  of such stories from a wider explanation meant that I stopped caring
  and skipped a few of these. If you've ever listened for long time to someone
  who loves to talk, this book will remind you of that. It's a bit disappointing,
  but I think if I further my interest into Derren Brown and what he does, I'll
  read from his reading list next time.
