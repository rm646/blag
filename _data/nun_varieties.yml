- type: Covent
  habitat: Convent
  notes: Sadly, nun populations are declining in most biomes, and these reservations house the majority of living nuns. Tame and lean, this nun favours dark spaces, kneeling, and quiet contemplation.

- type: Teaching
  habitat: Schools/nurseries
  notes: Being the main force generating new nuns, they are fierce, strong, and stern beyond what our current technology can measure. Though they most often work alone, they occasionally rut in the summer months over classroom space and student numbers.

- type: Market
  habitat: Grocers and markets
  notes: The primary food gatherers in nun communities.

- type: Street
  habitat: Rough towns, alleys
  notes: Rogue individuals from the other varieties. Very dangerous, these nuns often work as assassins, or as they are known in the underworld, nuns for hire.

- type: Battery
  habitat: Commercial convents
  notes: Used for large scale praying operations. Plump, earnest and docile.

- type: Christmas
  habitat: Christmas markets
  notes: Short lived working nuns.

- type: Halloween
  habitat: Pubs and bars
  notes: Drunkenly bawdy. Not true nuns, but like other holiday nuns they are very short lived. Often wear high heels.

- type: Hipster
  habitat: Wholefood cafes, undiscovered coffee shops
  notes: The only tech-savvy nun. Will be found carrying the latest iPhone, Airbook, and FitBit at a minimum. Also available on Tinder.
